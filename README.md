dm6icq
========

This was something that brought great enjoyment and decreased productivity back in the early-to-mid-2000s at GameSpy HQ.

external.pl is an external actions file for the centericq IM client; dm6check.pl is meant to be run as a scheduled task, once per minute (or however often you wish to poll the DM6 server). QueryTest.pm is a tweaked version of the Games::Quakeworld::Query perl module.
